## Requirements
* Visual Studio >= 2015
* DirectX Software Development Kit
* Windows 7 or above
* A windowed target (must not be fullscreen!)

## Setup
If you have installed DirectX in its usual location, then `$(DXSDK_DIR)` should have been created.  
If not, you need to manually adjust the environment variable to point to your installation, or, alternatively, manually configure the library and include paths in project settings.
