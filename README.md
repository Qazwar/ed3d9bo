## Requirements
* Visual Studio >= 2015
* DirectX Software Development Kit
* Windows 7 or above
* A windowed target (must not be fullscreen!)

## Setup
If you have installed DirectX in its usual location, then $(DXSDK_DIR) should have been created.  
If not, you need to manually adjust the variable to point to your installation, or, alternatively, manually configure the library and include paths in project settings.
